# CryptoPricePrediction

This is my failed attempt to get rich by predicting the price change of bitcoin!

I used these as features:
* Twitter sentiment analysis using BERT
* related cryptocurrency prices Eth, LTC, etc...
* price of gold, stock market
* google trend search
* And of course daily price of bitcoin

#### This project was just a hobby for me, and you should not take it too seriously. 

#### I'm too lazy to write documentation for this, but if you understand the code and you are willing to do so, let me know!

You are free to use this code for any purpose, including but not limited to: education, trading, business.

You can donate to me in bitcoin â‚¿!:
